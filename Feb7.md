## Entry Title: Subsystem Integration and Testing - PANCAKE FLIPPER
### Date: February 7, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To integrate various subsystems and conduct initial functional tests.
- Address any immediate issues found during the integration phase.

### Activities Conducted
1. **Subsystem Integration**:
    - Successfully integrated the power supply, camera module, flipper module, and control unit.
    - Established how communication between the Raspberry Pi and the microcontroller happens.

2. **Initial Testing**:
    - Made sure the camera module is compatible with the pi.
    - Made sure the camera module had real-time image acquisition and processing capabilities.

### Equations and Formulas
1. **Power Efficiency Calculation**:
   \\[
   \\eta = \\left(\\frac{P_{output}}{P_{input}}\\right) \\times 100\\%
   \\]
   Where:
   - \\( \\eta \\) = Efficiency
   - \\( P_{output} \\) = Output Power
   - \\( P_{input} \\) = Input Power


### Decisions Made
- Adjusted the electrical connections for better reliability and reduced noise interference.
- Approved the preliminary design for the user interface on the display module.

---

### Future Actions
- Schedule a full system test to evaluate the complete functionality.
- Begin preparing for the mid-term project presentation and review.
