## Entry Title: System Testing and Refinement - PANCAKE FLIPPER
### Date: February 14, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To perform comprehensive system testing to ensure all subsystems function cohesively.
- Identify and address any refinement needs based on the test results.

### Activities Conducted
1. **Full System Testing**:
    - Conducted a series of tests to verify the complete functionality of the Pancake Flipper, focusing on system integration and real-time operation.
    - Checked all mechanical and electronic interfaces for operational integrity.

2. **Performance Analysis**:
    - Evaluated the flipping mechanism's precision and the camera's ability to accurately detect pancake readiness.
    - Assessed the system's response times and efficiency under various load conditions.

### Equations and Formulas
1. **System Response Time**:
   \\[
   T = t_{finish} - t_{start}
   \\]
   Where:
   - \\( T \\) = Total Response Time
   - \\( t_{start} \\) = Time when the pancake is detected as ready
   - \\( t_{finish} \\) = Time when the flipping action is completed

### Decisions Made
- Resolved issues related to servo alignment which affected flipping accuracy.
- Enhanced camera settings to improve detection sensitivity under variable lighting conditions.

### Future Actions
- Adjust the power supply configuration to handle peak loads more efficiently.
- Plan for a demonstration session to showcase the project functionality to the class.
