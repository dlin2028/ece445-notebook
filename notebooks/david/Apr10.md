## Entry Title: Data Collection and Electronics Troubleshooting - PANCAKE FLIPPER
### Date: April 10, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To collect a diverse dataset of pancake images for training the AI classifier.
- Assist in troubleshooting and resolving issues with the linear actuator in the electronic control system.

### Activities Conducted
1. **Data Collection for AI Classifier**:
    - Began collecting images of pancakes at various stages of cooking to enhance the AI classifier's training dataset.
    - Organized the data collection process to cover a wide range of pancake types and cooking conditions.

2. **Electronics Troubleshooting**:
    - Diagnosed issues with the linear actuator, which was not operating as expected.
    - Conducted tests on the actuator's power supply and control signals to identify the fault.

### Decisions Made
- Decided to replace the faulty components of the linear actuator to ensure reliable operation.
- Planned to reconfigure the electronic control circuit to enhance stability and performance.

---

### Future Actions
- Continue the data collection for the AI classifier and begin preprocessing and labeling the images.
- Implement the modifications to the electronic control system and retest the linear actuator.
