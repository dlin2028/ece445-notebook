## Entry Title: Prototype Testing and Manual Operations - PANCAKE FLIPPER
### Date: March 28, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To perform initial testing of the pancake flipper prototype to ensure all mechanical components function correctly.
- Conduct manual pancake flipping tests to assess the basic functionality before integrating electronic controls.

### Activities Conducted
1. **Prototype Inspection and Assembly**:
    - Received the completed pancake flipper prototype from the machine shop.
    - Assembled and inspected the prototype to ensure all parts were correctly fabricated and assembled.

2. **Initial Mechanical Testing**:
    - Conducted mechanical tests to verify the functionality of the flipping mechanism and structural stability.
    - Adjusted and calibrated mechanical components to ensure smooth operation.

3. **Manual Pancake Flipping Tests**:
    - Performed manual tests by making pancakes and using the flipper to assess its practical performance without electronic controls.
    - Evaluated the ease of use, flipping accuracy, and consistency of the pancake cooking.

### Decisions Made
- Confirmed that the mechanical setup of the pancake flipper meets the project's initial specifications and requirements.
- Scheduled further adjustments and minor modifications to enhance flipping mechanics based on the manual test results.

### Future Actions
- Integrate electronic components and sensors with the prototype for automated control.
- Begin software integration and conduct controlled tests using the AI classifier.
