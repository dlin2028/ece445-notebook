## Entry Title: PCB Troubleshooting and Microcontroller Programming - PANCAKE FLIPPER
### Date: April 17, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To resolve issues with programming the ATmega328p microcontroller on the PCB.
- Ensure that the electronics are correctly set up and functioning for the pancake flipper's control system.

### Activities Conducted
1. **PCB Troubleshooting**:
    - Assisted James and Jason in diagnosing the PCB issues that were preventing the ATmega328p from being programmed.
    - Checked connections, solder joints, and component placements on the PCB for errors.

2. **Microcontroller Programming**:
    - Implemented changes to the hardware setup to improve connectivity and programming reliability.
    - Successfully programmed the ATmega328p after resolving the hardware issues.

### Decisions Made
- Recommended revising the PCB design to include clearer labeling and improved trace routing for easier debugging in the future.
- Decided to implement a standardized testing protocol for all newly assembled PCBs to catch issues early.
