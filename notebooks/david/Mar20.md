## Entry Title: AI Classifier Development - PANCAKE FLIPPER
### Date: March 20, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To develop and test an AI classifier for detecting bubble formation on pancakes to determine cooking status.
- Integrate the classifier with the Raspberry Pi for real-time image processing.

### Activities Conducted
1. **AI Classifier Development**:
    - Started programming the AI classifier using Python and TensorFlow, focusing on bubble detection to signal when pancakes are ready to flip.
    - Collected various images of pancakes at different cooking stages to train the classifier.

2. **Testing and Integration**:
    - Implemented initial tests of the classifier on static images to refine accuracy.
    - Began integrating the classifier with the Raspberry Pi's camera module for real-time testing.

### Decisions Made
- Chose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the classifier due to its effectiveness in image recognition tasks.
- Decided to increase the dataset size with more varied images to improve the classifier's robustness and accuracy.

### Future Actions
- Continue enhancing the AI classifier by expanding the dataset and adjusting model parameters.
- Start integrating real-time image processing with the pancake flipping mechanism once the prototype is available.
