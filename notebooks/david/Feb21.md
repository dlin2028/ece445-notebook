## Entry Title: Conceptualization and Component Selection - PANCAKE FLIPPER
### Date: February 14, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To refine the pancake flipping concept and finalize the list of components needed for the prototype.
- Identify suppliers and place orders for the necessary components.

### Activities Conducted
1. **Concept Refinement**:
    - Discussed the operational requirements of the pancake flipper, focusing on automation, safety, and user interaction.
    - Brainstormed various design approaches for the flipping mechanism and cooking surface.

2. **Component Selection**:
    - Identified essential components such as servos, sensors, and the griddle.
    - Reviewed various suppliers for these components and compared specifications to ensure compatibility and performance.

### Decisions Made
- Decided to use a high-torque servo for the flipping mechanism to handle the weight and motion effectively.
- Selected a Raspberry Pi for control operations due to its versatility and support for peripheral devices like cameras and sensors.

### Future Actions
- Place orders for the selected components.
- Start drafting the initial design sketches and circuit diagrams.
