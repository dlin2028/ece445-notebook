## Entry Title: AI Classifier Finalization and Strategy Pivot - PANCAKE FLIPPER
### Date: April 2, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To finalize the development of the AI image classifier for the pancake flipper.
- Transition the project approach from bubble counting to AI tagging for enhanced accuracy in detecting pancake readiness.

### Activities Conducted
1. **AI Classifier Finalization**:
    - Completed the coding and optimization of the AI classifier using advanced machine learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency.
    - Conducted extensive testing to validate the classifier's performance under various conditions.

2. **Strategy Pivot to AI Tagging**:
    - Decided to implement AI tagging, which uses comprehensive image analysis to assess pancake readiness, moving beyond simple bubble counting.
    - Updated the classifier to recognize different cooking stages based on overall visual cues rather than counting bubbles alone.

### Decisions Made
- Approved the integration of AI tagging techniques into the project to ensure a more robust and reliable detection system.
- Planned to update the system's software to seamlessly incorporate the new AI classifier.

### Future Actions
- Begin integrating the finalized AI classifier with the pancake flipper's control system.
- Prepare for a series of comprehensive field tests to evaluate the effectiveness of the new AI tagging approach.
