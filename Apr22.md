### Date: April 22, 2024
### Team Members: David Lin, Jason Kim, James Lu
### Supervisor: Professor Arne Fliflet
### Teaching Assistant: Abhisheka Mathur Sekar

### Objectives
- To address the ongoing issues with the custom H-bridge by replacing it with a commercial alternative.
- Ensure that the new H-bridge integrates seamlessly with the existing system and enhances the overall reliability.

### Activities Conducted
1. **Evaluation of Custom H-Bridge**:
    - Analyzed the performance issues with the custom H-bridge, identifying stability and overheating as primary concerns.
    - Concluded that the custom design was unable to meet the operational demands reliably.

2. **Selection and Integration of Commercial H-Bridge**:
    - Researched and selected a commercial H-bridge that matches the system's requirements for current and voltage.
    - Tested the integration of the new H-bridge with the system to ensure compatibility and improved performance.

### Decisions Made
- Officially decided to cease efforts on optimizing the custom H-bridge and proceed with a commercial solution.
- Approved the purchase and immediate implementation of the selected commercial H-bridge.
